## Challenge Summaries

### Fizz-Buzz

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by 'A' e.g. three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by 'B' e.g. five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is either eliminated.

Write a program that prints out the the pattern generated by such a scenario given the values of 'A'/'B' and 'N' which are read from an input text file. The input text file contains three space delimited numbers i.e. A, B, N. The program should then print out the final series of numbers using 'F' for fizz, 'B' for 'buzz' and 'FB' for fizz buzz.

### Sum of Primes

### Minimum Coins

You are given 3 coins of value 1, 3 and 5. You are also given a total which you have to arrive at. Find the minimum number of coins to arrive at it.

### Distinct Subsequences

A subsequence of a given sequence S consists of S with zero or more elements deleted. Formally, a sequence `Z = z1z2..zk` is a subsequence of `X = x1x2...xm`, if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of indicies of `X` such that for all `j=1,2,...k` we have `Xij = Zj`. E.g. `Z=bcdb` is a subsequence of `X=abcbdab` with corresponding index sequence `<2,3,5,7>`
